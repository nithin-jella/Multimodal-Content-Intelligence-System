This project implements a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, named **LoomRAG**, that leverages **OpenAI's CLIP** model for neural cross-modal image retrieval and semantic search, and **OpenAI's Whisper** model for audio processing. The system allows users to input text queries, images, or audio to retrieve multimodal responses seamlessly through vector embeddings. It features a comprehensive annotation interface for creating custom datasets and supports CLIP model fine-tuning with configurable parameters for domain-specific applications. The system also supports uploading images, PDFs, and audio files (including real-time recording) for enhanced interaction and intelligent retrieval capabilities through a Streamlit-based interface.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

![LoomRAG Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc2a2b8d-801e-42dc-8b07-089a8f8b5641)
*Architecture Diagram*

1. **Data Indexing**:

   - Text, images, and PDFs are preprocessed and embedded using the CLIP model
   - Embeddings are stored in a vector database for fast and efficient retrieval
   - Support for direct URL-based image indexing and website content scraping

2. **Query Processing**:

   - Text queries / image-based queries are converted into embeddings for semantic search
   - Uploaded images, audio files and PDFs are processed and embedded for comparison
   - The system performs a nearest neighbor search in the vector database to retrieve relevant text, images, and audio

3. **Response Generation**:

   - For text results: Optionally refined or augmented using a language model
   - For image results: Directly returned or enhanced with image captions
   - For audio results: Returned with relevant metadata and transcriptions where applicable
   - For PDFs: Extracts text content and provides relevant sections

4. **Image Annotation**:

   - Dedicated annotation page for managing uploaded images
   - Support for creating and managing multiple datasets simultaneously
   - Flexible annotation workflow for efficient data labeling
   - Dataset organization and management capabilities

5. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Custom CLIP model training on annotated images
   - Configurable training parameters for optimization
   - Integration of fine-tuned models into the search pipeline

     - Upload images or PDFs to retrieve contextually relevant results
     - Upload or record audio files
     - Add images using URLs
     - Scrape and index website content
     - Search using uploaded images
     - Annotate uploaded images
     - Fine-tune CLIP models with custom parameters
     - Use fine-tuned models for improved search results
